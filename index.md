# Privacy Policy for Trustiee Extension

Effective Date: 2024-04-17

Trustiee is a Chrome extension designed to help users summarize privacy policies and terms of service using AI.

## What data do we collect?

We **do not collect, store, or share** any personal user data. The extension only reads content from the currently active webpage to generate AI summaries. All processing is done securely via third-party APIs.

## Third-party services

To provide summarization features, Trustiee sends selected page text to:

- [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai)
- [Ark Volcengine (火山方舟)](https://www.volcengine.com/product/ark)

These services are used **only to generate summaries**. We do not log or store the data they return.

## Permissions

Trustiee uses browser permissions like `host_permissions` to scan and summarize text content on web pages. This access is **used locally only** and never stored or sent elsewhere.

## Contact

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, contact us at: `your-email@example.com`
